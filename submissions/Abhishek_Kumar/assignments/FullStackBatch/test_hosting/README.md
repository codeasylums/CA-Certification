## CodeAsylums Test
Welcome to the hosting challenge part :

### Objectives

This will help you to test the hosting part of project :

- If you are attempting only `frontend-React` challenge, host with `AWS-amplify` or `Heroku` or any hosting React services.

- If you are attempting `fullstack-challenge` challenge, host with `AWS`, `GCP` or `Azure` cloud systems.

- Note the global-link, and keep it handy to be used at `test_git`.
